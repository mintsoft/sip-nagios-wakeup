WTF are you doing?
------------------

Yes exactly. Email, push notifications etc just don't work that well. 

We find that:

* GMail client sometimes just doesn't notify that an email has arrived until the user manually polls (not so useful if asleep)
* K9Mail occasionally ends up unable to poll until the user manually polls (see above)
* Android Push notifications sometimes don't get delivered.
* SMS sometimes just don't get delivered.

So! We phone the telephone which either awakens a human, or alternatively awakens the phone itself; thus letting the millions of email notifications arrive (or at least standing a better chance of it happening).
